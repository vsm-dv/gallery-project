## ðŸ“· Gallery project
<br>
This page was based on a practice exercise from the <b>Software Development course</b> at <b>Cubos Academy</b>. In addition to the tasks assigned by the instructors, there is a section that stores only the favorite images, and a theme button. <br><br>
Click <a href='https://vsm-dv.github.io/gallery-project/'>here</a> to access the page.<br>

### How the page works
The page has a menu that allows the user to navigate between the main and the favorite sections. There is also a theme button at the end of the menu, which enables light or dark mode.

You can zoom any picture by clicking on it. A modal will appear, and if you double-click on the zoomed image, it will be added to the favorites section, and a like icon will be shown over the favorited picture (in the main page and the modal). This icon is hidden in the favorites section.
If you want to remove it from the favorites, just double-click on the image zoomed in the Home section (that is, the one that has a like icon over it).<br><br>
On the modal, it is also possible to see the previous and the next images by clicking on the arrows.
You can zoom the images from the favorites section, which will not have the like icon over it.
